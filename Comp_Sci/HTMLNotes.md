Hyper Text Markup Language
Cascading Style Sheets
webpages can be made up of HTML CSS Javascript 
HTML is a tag based markup language e.g <head> .. </head> 

Anything in <head> affects the browser
Anything in <body> affects the webpage 
use emmet to start HTML file by typing "!" and pressing tab
Link CSS to HTML file using <link> tag 
use <div> to seperate page into blocks - then embed

need to use CSS selectors - (<div> variants) or tags when setting CSS setting to apply to individual parts
can also set a ID using " id ="a name" " (unique in the page)
can also use classes, which allow targeting of multiple elements,
in CSS, to reference selectors:
 id = #
 class = . 

ca define div ids when defining the div eg:
<div #231>.....</div>

can define div classes with:
<div class="cards"> .... </div> 
Sizing in CSS - can use pixels, ems, rems, % .
pixels = actual physisical pixels#
% = percentage of start size
rem = standard text size so 1 rem - 16px 
ems = 

can target layered tags (eg <h1> inside <nav>) by doing "nav h1{ ...

layout items inside a <div>
in CSS, when referenceing divisions:
type "display: flex;" otherwise will recieve "display: block;"

block = big squared off area around each element
flex = efficient, dynamic box around each element

can use "align-items" with "flex start" and "flex end" and "center"
can use "justify-content:" with same as above to do horzontal location 
can also do "flex-direction: " with "vertical" or "horizontal" to change whole system
